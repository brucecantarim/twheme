# twheme
### Modular OOP php, twig and sass theme framework for Wordpress

Still a work in progress, being used to speed development between multiple clients.
It requires Timber and ACF plugins. Timber documentation is really helpful if you're anxious to try it.
The idea behind this plugin is to improve Wordpress development, relying in few plugins as possible.

Please don't use it in production just yet, Twheme is not completed yet.
There's still a lot of features being implemented and core code changes to be done, so
it might break your work in the next releases. It's wise to wait. 

A live version can be found here: http://jotacom.com.br/wp_vermeer


### To do list:
- Add Dashboard Customization.
- Improve the Core folder organization.
- Improve dependencies and routines with Bower and Grunt.
- Implement MtHaml and Susy.
- Implement Typescript.
- Implement Vafpress for Admin Configuration.
- Implement Custom Fields creation, to remove the need for ACF.
- Add support for child themes.
- Add woocommerce support.
- Add a default themes package.
- Create the docs.
