Modular OOP php, twig and sass theme framework for Wordpress

Still a work in progress, being used to speed development between multiple clients.
It requires Timber and ACF plugins.

Please don't use it in production just yet, I need to improve and clean up most of the code first.

A live version can be found here: http://jotacom.com.br/wp_vermeer


To do list:
- Add Dashboard Customization.
- Simplify the Site.php code, instantianting the classes inside the constructor.
- Implement Typescript.
- Implement Vafpress for Admin Configuration.
- Add support for child themes.
- Add a default themes package.
- Create the docs.
