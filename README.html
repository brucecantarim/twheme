<h3 id="modularoopphptwigandsassthemeframeworkforwordpress">Modular OOP php, twig and sass theme framework for Wordpress</h3>

<p>Still a work in progress, being used to speed development between multiple clients.
It requires Timber and ACF plugins. Timber documentation is really helpful if you&#8217;re anxious to try it.
The idea behind this plugin is to improve Wordpress development, relying in few plugins as possible.</p>

<p>Please don&#8217;t use it in production just yet, Twheme is not completed yet.
There&#8217;s still a lot of features being implemented and core code changes to be done, so
it might break your work in the next releases. It&#8217;s wise to wait. </p>

<p>A live version can be found here: http://jotacom.com.br/wp_vermeer</p>
